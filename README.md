# HPL Jump High

This is a research app to use the accelerometer to measure jump characteristics ( height, velocity, time of propulsion, and peak acceleration) in order to detect patterns to predict premature injuries using machine learning techniques.

This is currently the first version, I am still working to add more features like time of propulsion and saving the data in the app.

## Features
1. Track your daily jump routines 
2. Detect user's jump patterns
3. Detect early signs of injury (work in progress) 
4. Work with any android phone with accelerometer
5. Working with any sample rate of accelerometer.
6. Jump streak count to motivate users' exercise. (in progress)
7. Measure and calculate user's average and standard deviation of jump height, jumpcount, initial velocity, TFlight, peak acceleration, time of propulsion and others! 
8. Tolerates users phone holding position inaccuracies.

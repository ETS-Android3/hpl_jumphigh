        <ol>
            <li>Find a comfortable area to start vertical jumping</li>
            <li>Push the "start" button when you are ready to start</li>
            <li>Hold the phone with both hands with each hand gripping one of the long ends of the phone.
            Press the phone firmly against stomach just below belly-button with palms pressing firmly against
            the top edge of hip bones.
            Make sure to hold the phone horizontally with the screen facing front
            with the top of the phone pointing to the left.
            Hold the phone securely in this position while performing the maximum effort vertical jump.

 </li>
            <li> <strong>Stand still for 5 seconds before jumping.</strong></li>
            <li>Perform 5 maximum effort jumps. Start each jump from the standing position.
             Bend the knees and hips and then explode upward to achieve your maximum jump height. After each jump, return to the standing posture, and repeat to yield 5 total jumps.</li>

            <li>When done, push the "stop and save data" button at the bottom.
               This leads you to a pop up of a file share window.
               Click "Add to drive" to save the csv into your drive.  </li>
    <li> Click the "results" button to see your information,
        eg: Avg Jump height, Average Initial Velocity, and time of propulsion. </li>
